## Key Insights

- ✅ Prematurely going into detail in system design interviews can be detrimental, as it can lead to wasted time and backtracking. Waiting for feedback and focusing on important details can help prevent this.
- ✅ Having a set architecture in mind may limit flexibility and hinder the ability to adapt to changing requirements. Being open to different approaches and considering the specific scenario is important.
- ✅ Keeping the system design simple and avoiding excessive focus on specific components allows for a broader perspective and potential reuse of components across the system.
- ✅ Making points without justifications can weaken the validity of your choices. Providing clear reasoning and explanations for design decisions demonstrates thoughtful consideration.
- ✅ Staying updated on current technologies and off-the-shelf solutions can showcase knowledge and efficiency in system design, potentially saving time and effort in implementation.
