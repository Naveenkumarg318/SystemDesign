The video explains that distributed caching is essential when dealing with commonly used data queries, and avoiding computations that can slow down the system. The video explores problems that can arise in distributed caching such as poor revocation policies, thrashing and data consistency, and suggests solutions such as choosing the best caching policy and the positioning of the cache. The video also explains the two methods of using caching in database systems: write-through and write-back, and suggests a hybrid mechanism to address the challenges posed by both methods. Overall, the video concludes by emphasizing the significance of caching in system design and suggesting further learning resources.

00:00:00 -> is solved by using a cache is when commonly used data is queried, this helps avoid repeatedly computing the same data saving considerable time and resources. The second problem is when computations need to be avoided, for example, in finding the average of all users in a database, instead of finding the average every time a request is made, finding it once and storing it in the cache is the better option. Finally, to avoid putting a lot of load on the database, a distributed cache system can be used. Storing everything in the cache is not feasible as search times increase and storing too much data in the cache becomes expensive, hence the cache policy must be well designed. The cache policy is the deciding factor in when data is loaded or evicted, and different policies such as LRU or sliding window-based policies are used.


00:05:00 -> In this section, the video discusses three problems that can occur with distributed caching: poor revocation policy, thrashing, and data consistency. Poor revocation policies can be harmful because unnecessary extra calls are made, and thrashing can occur when constantly inputting and outputting into the cache without ever using the results. This section also examines where to place the cache, either close to the database or close to the servers, and there are benefits and drawbacks to both. Global cache is a better option for data consistency, while local memory cache is faster and simpler to implement. Finally, the video explains that a write-through cache makes updates to the data immediately, which can cause data inconsistency, whereas a write-back cache updates the data periodically, leading to consistency.


00:10:00 -> In this section, the video explains two methods of using caching in database systems: write-through and write-back. Write-through involves updating the cache before writing to the database while write-back involves writing to the database, then updating the cache. However, while write-back is efficient, it can be problematic if there are multiple servers with the same cache. The solution is to use a hybrid mechanism, where not all entries are written-back immediately, but persisting entries in bulk to minimize network calls.
