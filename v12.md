#  What is an API and how do you design it?

This video discusses the concept of APIs and how to design them effectively. The speaker emphasizes the importance of accurate naming, defining parameters and return types, and avoiding unnecessary information. They also talk about error handling, suggesting that developers define expected errors based on common scenarios instead of checking for every possible error. The speaker advises against mixing up routing with the action and highlights the importance of clear and unambiguous naming. They also discuss the reasons why APIs should not have side effects and suggest breaking down the API into smaller functions. Additionally, the video touches on handling large API responses through pagination or fragmentation, and the importance of data consistency and caching. Overall, a well-designed API should facilitate smooth interaction between users and code and handle service degradation effectively.

00:00:00 -> In this section, the speaker discusses the concept of APIs and how to design them effectively. APIs are a documented way for external users to interact with code and get their work done. They use the example of a function that finds all the admins in a WhatsApp group to explain the concept of an API. The speaker emphasizes the importance of naming the API correctly and defining the parameters and return type accurately. They also caution against including unnecessary parameters or stuffing the response with excessive information. They suggest optimizing the API with additional parameters only when necessary for speed and efficiency. Overall, the key takeaway is that APIs should be well-designed contracts that facilitate smooth and efficient interaction between users and code.

00:05:00 -> In this section, the speaker discusses the design of error handling in APIs. They mention that some developers define every possible error for their API, while others choose to return a generic error for any issue. The speaker suggests that it is not necessary to check for every possible error and recommends defining the expected errors based on common scenarios. They also talk about the responsibility of the API and how it should handle errors such as a group not existing or a user being deleted. The speaker advises against taking no responsibility and just throwing a 404 error, as these errors can be expected from the service. Additionally, the speaker mentions the importance of understanding how HTTP response and request objects work when exposing APIs on an HTTP endpoint. They talk about the routing of the API and how it should accurately represent the function being called. The speaker warns against mixing up routing with the action and suggests using appropriate HTTP methods like GET or POST. They also mention the importance of clear and unambiguous naming in the API design.

00:10:00 -> In this section, the speaker discusses two reasons why APIs should not have side effects. Firstly, having multiple operations and flags in a single API function can make the API design confusing and difficult to test. Secondly, atomicity is important, especially when certain actions need to happen in a specific order. The speaker suggests breaking down the API into smaller, more specific functions to mitigate these issues. Additionally, the speaker mentions two approaches for handling large API responses. One option is to use pagination, where the client requests a certain number of results at a time. Another option is to fragment the API response, sending it in multiple pieces with sequential numbers. The speaker also mentions the importance of considering data consistency and the use of caching in APIs to improve performance and reduce database load.

00:15:00 -> In this section, the speaker discusses API design and how to implement it effectively. They explain that a well-designed API should handle service degradation by providing the essential information without completely failing. This concept is demonstrated by passing only the name of a person as input.
