# What is the public subscriber model?

The "What is the Publisher-Subscriber Model?" YouTube video explores the use of the Publisher-Subscriber model as an alternative to request-response architecture in microservice systems for event-driven services. In contrast to request-response, where SS one sends messages to S two and S zero and may cause delays, the Publisher-Subscriber model uses a message broker to route and persist messages, allowing SS one to send a success message to the client immediately. This architecture simplifies system understanding, decouples responsibilities, and provides transaction guarantees. However, the Publisher-Subscriber model may face challenges in financial systems that demand consistency due to the potential for incorrect message order and multiple publications of changes, leading to inconsistent account balances. Despite its advantages like real-time notifications and scalability, care must be taken when applying the Publisher-Subscriber Model to architect complex systems

  00:00:00 -> In this section of the video, the speaker discusses the Publisher-Subscriber model as an alternative to the request-response architecture for event-driven services in a microservice architecture. SS one is the service that receives a request and, upon processing it, sends messages to other services S zero and S two for further processing. In a request-response architecture, S two might have to wait for both messages before sending responses, potentially leading to delays and timeouts. The Publisher-Subscriber model addresses this issue by having SS one send messages to a message broker, such as Kafka or RabbitMQ, instead of directly to S two and S zero. This message broker is responsible for routing and persisting messages and ensuring they are delivered to their intended recipients. SS one can then send a success message to the client as soon as it has published the messages, decoupling the responsibilities and reducing dependencies among services. This architecture also simplifies system understanding by having a single point of failure and eases development by providing transaction guarantees
   
  00:05:00 -> In this section of the "What is the Publisher Subscriber Model?" YouTube video, the speaker discusses the disadvantages of the publisher-subscriber model in the context of financial systems that require consistency. When there are multiple services involved in a transaction, there can be issues with the order in which messages are processed and the impact on the accounts involved. The speaker uses an example of an invoice generator and a fund transfer service, explaining how a gateway service can send messages to both services, but if one service is down, the transaction may result in an incorrect account balance. Additionally, the publisher-subscriber model does not guarantee item potency, meaning changes made to an item may be published multiple times, leading to inconsistencies

  00:10:00 -> In this section of the video, the speaker discusses the use of the Publisher Subscriber Model in architecting complex systems and event-driven services. The model allows for the publishing of events and the existence of subscribers for those events, making it ideal for businesses requiring real-time notifications, such as gaming services or social media platforms like Twitter. However, developers must account for potential duplicate requests using the same request ID and ignore unnecessary ones, which is not handled by the architecture itself. Overall, while the Publisher Subscriber Model offers advantages like scalability and decoupling of components, it may not be suitable for all businesses and should be utilized with careful consideration
