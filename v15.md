#  Why do Databases fail? AntiPatterns to avoid!

The "Why do Databases fail? AntiPatterns to avoid!" YouTube video discusses the antipattern of using databases as message queues in large systems. When servers use a database for messaging, they insert messages into the database and then poll it for new messages at regular intervals. However, this approach results in many read operations, putting extra load on the database and affecting user experience if intervals are too long. Additionally, databases are optimized for either reading or writing, so frequent messages can fill up the database quickly, requiring significant storage or complex deletion logic. Moreover, databases may struggle to scale with the addition of new servers and increased message volume, potentially leading to database failure. The speaker suggests using specialized message queues as a more efficient alternative, as they directly push messages to servers and handle large message volumes effectively. However, this solution may not be ideal for smaller systems or those with infrequent message traffic. The video emphasizes the importance of carefully considering the pros and cons before deciding between using a database or message queue for message handling in large systems

  00:00:00 -> In this section of the "Why do Databases fail? AntiPatterns to avoid!" YouTube video, the speaker discusses the antipattern of using databases as message queues. According to the speaker, this practice is inefficient and leads to several issues. When servers like s1, s2, and s3 use a database to send messages to each other, they insert new messages into the database. However, the database cannot communicate these messages directly to the servers; instead, they have to poll the database at specific intervals to check for new messages. This results in a lot of read operations, putting extra load on the database, especially if polling intervals are frequent. Alternatively, long polling intervals can lead to poor user experience and inefficiency. The speaker also notes that databases are generally optimized for either reading or writing, not both. As a result, frequent messages between servers can fill up the database, requiring substantial storage space or complex deletion logic. Another significant issue is scalability, as adding new servers and increasing message volume can strain the database's ability to handle the workload

AntiPatterns to avoid!", the speaker discusses the issue of using databases as message queues in large systems and the potential drawbacks of this approach. He explains that when a database is used as a message queue, it can lead to inefficiencies and complications due to polling intervals and excessive read operations. Instead, the speaker recommends using specialized message queues, which push messages to the server and are optimized for handling large numbers of messages. However, he also notes that message queues may not be the best solution for smaller systems or those with infrequent message traffic.
