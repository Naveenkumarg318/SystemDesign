#### Summary
- 🌍 Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) can improve website performance and efficiency by caching static pages and customizing data for different devices and locations.
- 📚 CDNs store static information in a global cache and redirect requests for static content to this cache, while more dynamic requests are sent to the server and database.
- 🌐 CDNs can be distributed to avoid single points of failure and improve scalability.
- 🌍 CDNs can be further optimized by horizontally sharding the cache based on country or location, reducing irrelevant information and improving performance.
- ⚡️ CDNs improve page load times, which is crucial for user experience and can impact user engagement and conversion rates.
- 🌍 CDNs can be built in different countries or leveraged through specialized solutions like Akamai to ensure proximity to users and compliance with regulations.
- 💻 Popular CDNs like S3 (Amazon Simple Storage Service) offer cost-effective, reliable, and user-friendly solutions for hosting files.
