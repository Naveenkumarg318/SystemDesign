# What's an Event Driven System?

#### Summary
- 🌟 Event-driven architecture allows services to communicate through events rather than directly interacting with each other.
- 🌐 Services send events to an event bus, indicating that something has changed and can be consumed by interested subscribers.
- 🎮 Event-driven architecture is commonly used in gaming systems to ensure fair gameplay and handle delayed responses.
- 🏗️ Event-driven architecture offers advantages such as availability, easy debugging, smooth service replacement, and transactional guarantees.
- ❌ Disadvantages include challenges in ensuring consistency, lack of fine-tuned control, difficulty in determining event consumption, and complex system flow.
- ✉️ Sending emails or depending on external system responses can be problematic in event-driven architectures.
- 📚 Understanding and transitioning out of event-driven architecture can be difficult for software teams.

#### Highlights
- 🌟 Event-driven architecture enables services to communicate through events, improving scalability and decoupling services.
- 🌐 Services publish events to an event bus, while subscribers consume relevant events to update their internal state.
- 🎮 Gaming systems utilize event-driven architecture to handle delayed responses and ensure fair gameplay.
- 🏗️ Event-driven architecture offers advantages such as availability, easy debugging, smooth service replacement, and transactional guarantees.
- ❌ Disadvantages include challenges in ensuring consistency, lack of fine-tuned control, and complex system flow.
- ✉️ Sending emails or relying on external system responses can pose challenges in event-driven architectures.
- 📚 Transitioning out of event-driven architecture and understanding system flow can be challenging for software teams.
