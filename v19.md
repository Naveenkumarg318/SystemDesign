# Introduction to NoSQL databases

Summary

NoSQL databases are popular for their scalability, flexibility, and ability to handle large amounts of data. They store data differently than SQL databases, and have advantages and disadvantages in terms of data storage, retrieval, and consistency.

Key Insights

- 💡 NoSQL databases offer benefits such as scalability, flexible schemas, and built-in partitioning. However, they have challenges with joins and consistency.
- 💡 The use of distributed consensus and quorum in NoSQL databases ensures data replication and availability, but sacrifices a bit of consistency.
- 💡 Sorted string tables and compaction in NoSQL databases optimize data storage and help manage duplicate records efficiently.
- 💡 NoSQL databases are suitable for scenarios that require scalability, flexibility, and efficient data retrieval, but may not be ideal for applications that prioritize consistency or complex joins.
