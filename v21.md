## Key Insights

- 💡 Reliability and availability are crucial for service operation and revenue generation, not just efficiency.
- 💡 Health checks and load balancers play a vital role in ensuring service availability and handling server failures.
- 💡 A two-way heartbeat mechanism helps maintain consistency and avoid zombies in the system.
- 💡 Service discovery simplifies communication between services by providing a snapshot of available services and their endpoints.
- 💡 The health service can monitor changes in the service snapshot and ensure the health of the system.
- 💡 Caching the service snapshot on the load balancer can improve performance and reduce dependence on individual services for address information.
- 💡 Service discovery and health checks are essential components in building reliable and scalable micro-services architecture.
