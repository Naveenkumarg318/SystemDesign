## Key Insights

-  Synchronous data replication ensures consistency but may introduce latency and potential data inconsistencies in case of failures. Asynchronous replication reduces the load on the database but can result in out-of-sync data.
- The master/slave architecture allows for scalability in read operations and provides a backup of data. However, it requires careful consideration of failure scenarios and the potential for split-brain problems.
- Sharding can distribute data and reduce the impact of node failures, but it introduces complexities in data coordination and synchronization.
- AlgoExpert is recommended for algorithm preparation, offering a curated set of questions and explanations for interviews.
