# Containers and Virtualisation in Cloud Computing ☁️.

## Summary

Virtualization and containers are important in cloud computing. Initially, code was run on dedicated hardware, but virtual machines and containers allow for better resource management and scalability. Containers, like Docker, provide a lightweight and flexible solution, while virtual machines offer stronger isolation. Both have advantages and disadvantages.

## Key Insights

- ✅ Virtual machines provide strong isolation and boundary management, making them suitable for running programs with minimal interference.
- 💡 Cloud computing enables small businesses to rent hardware from big companies, reducing upfront costs and maintenance efforts.
- 🌟 Containers, like Docker, offer a lightweight alternative to virtual machines, allowing for faster boot times and easier resource management.
- 🤔 Containers may have some performance drawbacks, such as slower speed and possible firewall issues, compared to virtual machines.
- 🎯 The platform independence offered by virtualization and containers is a game-changer, allowing code to run on different operating systems without modification.
- 💭 The overhead of container management may not be worth it for simple applications, and virtual machines might still be preferred in certain scenarios.
- 🔑 TLDR: Virtualization and containers provide efficient resource management in cloud computing, but the choice between virtual machines and containers depends on specific requirements and trade-offs.
