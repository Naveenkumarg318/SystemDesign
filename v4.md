# What is Consistent Hashing and Why is it used?

### Main Idea: Consistent hashing distributes data/requests across servers in a distributed system efficiently and fault-tolerantly using a ring-based approach.

__Key Points:__

    Hashing: Each server and request is mapped to a point on a ring using a hash function.
    Request Routing: Requests are routed to the server closest to their hashed point on the ring.
    Load Balancing: Servers are evenly distributed on the ring, ensuring balanced load and preventing overload.
    Fault Tolerance: Server failure doesn't disrupt the system; nearby servers handle its requests.
    Applications: Used in web caches, databases, and load balancers for improved performance and reliability.

__Additional Details:__

    The ring analogy helps visualize server distribution and request routing.
    Adding/removing servers involves calculating their positions on the ring based on their IDs.
    Consistent hashing offers efficiency, fault tolerance, and ease of use for distributed systems.
