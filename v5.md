# What is Message Queue and where it is used ?

## Key points:

  **Traditional pizza shop model**: Orders are taken and pizzas are made sequentially. This can lead to bottlenecks and unhappy customers if there are many orders.
  Improved model with asynchronous processing: Orders are added to a list and pizzas are made concurrently. 
  This allows the system to handle more orders and keep customers happy.
  
  **Challenges with persistence**: If a server crashes, the orders in its memory are lost. To solve this, orders need to be stored in a database.
  
  **Introducing a message queue**: A message queue is a central place to store tasks (orders in this case). Servers pick up tasks from the queue and process them.

  -> *This message queue acts like a notifier which checks heartbeat/working for server for every qunatum time and performs sort of load balancing/consistent hashing to avoid duplicates*.
  
  ***Benefits of using a message queue:***
  
   **Reliability**: If a server crashes, the tasks in the queue are not lost. They can be picked up by another server.
   
   **Scalability**: The system can easily handle more load by adding more servers. The queue will distribute the tasks evenly among the servers.
   
   **Flexibility**: Different types of tasks can be put in the queue, making the system more versatile.

### Examples of message queues:

 1. RabbitMQ
 2. Amazon SQS
 3. Apache Kafka.
