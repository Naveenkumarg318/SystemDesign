# What is DATA SHARDING?

Database sharding is a technique used in database management where a large database is divided into smaller, more manageable parts called "shards." Each shard is a subset of the entire dataset and is stored on a separate server or database instance. This approach is employed to distribute the load and improve performance by allowing for parallel processing of data across multiple shards. Sharding is commonly used to scale horizontally, enabling a system to handle increased data volume and higher transaction rates. Each shard operates independently, and the database system coordinates data retrieval and storage across the shards to present a unified view to the application.

***Example***

Imagine you have a massive library with lots of books, and you want to organize it more efficiently. Instead of keeping all the books on a single bookshelf (like a monolithic database), you decide to use sharding.

In the sharding approach, you create smaller bookshelves, called "shards," and each shard holds a specific range of books. For instance, one shard might have books with titles starting with A-M, and another with titles N-Z. Each shard is like a mini-library, handling its own set of books independently.

Now, if someone asks for a book, you can quickly figure out which shard it's on based on the book's title. If the library gets more books, you can add new shards, ensuring that the workload is spread across multiple shelves. This is similar to how database sharding worksâ€”it divides a large dataset into smaller, manageable pieces to improve performance and scalability.
